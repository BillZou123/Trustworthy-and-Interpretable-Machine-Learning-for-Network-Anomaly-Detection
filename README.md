# Trustworthy-and-Interpretable-Machine-Learning-for-Network-Anomaly-Detection

This project explores the use of four main ML models: KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression for the task of network anomaly detection. The four ML models are evaluted based on their accuracy, running time as well as interpretability. Trustworthy refers to high accuracy and low running time, whole interpretable refers to high interpretability, meaning that the prediction and the reason for making the prediction are easy to understand and straight-forward.
